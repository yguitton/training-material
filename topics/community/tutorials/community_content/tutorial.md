Galaxy *[Special Interest Group](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig)* (**SIG**)s work hard to build and maintain training resources. The GTN has worked hard to acknowledge this and offer nice impact pages to communities.

Here is a list of resources that you can use!

# Maintainer Home

Maintaining resources is **fundamental** to the quality and usefulness of any software resource. We do *not* throw code over the wall!

To help topic maintainers to quickly recognise what materials need updating and fixing, topic **Maintainer Homes** were built.

> <hands-on-title>Go to your topic Maintainer Home</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Go to any GTN training topic of interest.
> 2. Scroll down past the tutorials, and click on the "Maintainer Home" button
>
>    {% snippet topics/community/faqs/maintainer_home.md %}
>
> 3. Explore the Maintainer Home!
>    - For example, the [Single Cell Maintainer Home]({% link topics/single-cell/maintainer.md %})
>
{: .hands_on}

You may instantly see some key information missing from tutorials, or how long its been since someone checked it! Time to update some materials!

You can see an example from the Single-cell topic below:

<iframe
    src="/training-material/topics/single-cell/maintainer.html"
    width="100%"
    height="800"
    style="border: none;"
    title="Single-Cell Topic Maintainer Home">
</iframe>

# Community Home

Where the **Maintainer Home** helps you sustain your community, the **Community Home** helps you show off your community. An end-of-year gift in 2024, this page will sift through news, events, and GTN contributions for your community tag of interest (example: single-cell) and provide a beautiful visualization of your efforts.

> <hands-on-title>Go to your topic Community Home</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Go to any GTN training topic of interest.
> 2. Scroll down past the tutorials, and click on the "Community Home" button
>
>    {% snippet topics/community/faqs/community_home.md %}
>
> 3. Explore the Community Home!
>    - For example, the [Single Cell Community Home]({% link topics/single-cell/community.md %})

# Topic usage statistics

Next up, you might want to know how many people are actually using your materials? Welcome to your **Topic usage statistics**! You may have already found this, actually, as it's (currently) at the bottom of the Maintainer Home.

> <hands-on-title>Go to your topic usage statistics</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Go to any GTN training topic of interest.
> 2. Scroll down past the tutorials, and click on the "Maintainer Home" button
>
>    {% snippet topics/community/faqs/maintainer_home.md %}
>
> 3. Scroll down to the section "Statistics For Your Materials"
> 4. Explore the usage statistics!
>    - For example, the [Single Cell Usage Statistics]({% link topics/single-cell/maintainer.md %}#statistics-for-your-materials)
>
{: .hands_on}
