The **Community Home** shows statistics for the topic (e.g. number of tutorials, slides, events, contributors, etc),
as well as annual "Year in review" sections listing all new additions to the topic/community for each year.

You can find your **Community Home** by
1. Opening the GTN **Topic** page of your choice
2. Scrolling down to the **Community Resources** section (below the list tutorials)
3. Clicking the **Community Home** button

For example, have a look at the [Single Cell Community Home]({% link topics/single-cell/community.md %})
