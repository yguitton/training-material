Pseudobulk analysis is a powerful technique that bridges the gap between single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data. It involves aggregating gene expression data from groups of cells within the same biological replicate, such as a mouse or patient, typically based on clustering or cell type annotations ({% cite Murphy2022 %}).

A key advantage of this approach in differential expression (DE) analysis is that it avoids treating individual cells as independent samples, which can underestimate variance and lead to inflated significance or overly optimistic p-values ({% cite Squair2021 %}). This occurs because cells from the same biological replicate are inherently more similar to each other than cells from different samples. By grouping data into pseudobulk samples, the analysis aligns with the experimental design, as in bulk RNA-seq, leading to more reliable and robust statistical results ({% cite Murphy2022 %}).

Beyond enhancing statistical validity, pseudobulk analysis enables the identification of cell-type-specific gene expression and functional changes across biological conditions. It balances the detailed resolution of single-cell data with the statistical power of bulk RNA-seq, providing insights into the functional transcriptomic landscape relevant to biological questions. Overall, for DE analysis in multi-sample single-cell experiments, pseudobulk approaches demonstrate superior performance compared to single-cell-specific DE methods ({% cite Squair2021 %}).

In this tutorial, we will guide you through a pseudobulk analysis workflow using the **Decoupler** ({% cite Badia-iMompel2022 %}) and **edgeR** ({% cite Liu2015 %}) tools available in Galaxy. These tools facilitate functional and differential expression analysis, and their output can be integrated with other Galaxy tools to visualize results, such as creating Volcano Plots, which we will also cover in this tutorial.

# Get the Data!

## Overview of the Data

The dataset used in this tutorial is an `AnnData` object containing a subset of single-cell RNA-seq data, specifically including non-classical monocytes (NCMs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) from bone marrow and peripheral blood samples. This subset was selected to illustrate differential gene expression between two immune cell types across two biologically distinct tissues. A portion of the data corresponding to bone marrow was derived from a published study {% cite rettkowski2025modulation %}.

In this tutorial, we will focus on these two cell populations and explore how their expression profiles differ between bone marrow and blood using pseudobulk analysis. The dataset includes three bone marrow samples and seven blood samples.

Pseudobulk analysis is an advanced approach in single-cell data analysis. It involves aggregating single-cell expression data by group (e.g., by cell type and condition) to perform bulk-style analyses while preserving single-cell resolution through metadata.

For this tutorial, we assume familiarity with standard single-cell data formats, such as `AnnData` or `Seurat` objects, and prior experience with single-cell workflows, particularly clustering and cell type annotation. We will use the `decoupler` tool to perform the pseudobulk aggregation and downstream differential analysis {% cite decoupler-pseudobulk %}.

If you're new to these concepts, we recommend exploring the following tutorials before performing pseudobulk analysis:

- [Clustering 3K PBMCs with Scanpy]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-scanpy-pbmc3k/tutorial.md %}): Learn how to perform clustering and cell type annotation using Galaxy's Scanpy and Anndata tool suites.
- [Clustering 3K PBMCs with Seurat]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-seurat-pbmc3k/tutorial.md %}): Explore an alternative approach to clustering and annotation using Seurat within Galaxy.
- [Combining single-cell datasets after pre-processing]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin-combine-datasets/tutorial.md %}): Learn how to merge multiple single-cell datasets into one AnnData object and enrich it with experimental metadata.

The data object, which you will import from Zenodo into Galaxy via the provided link, has been preprocessed, analysed, and annotated. It includes the following key observation metadata:
- **annotated**: The assigned cell type.
- **condition**: The experimental condition or sample group.
- **batch**: The sample identifier.
- **tissue**: Indicates the tissue of origin (bone marrow or peripheral blood).

# Generation of the Pseudobulk Count Matrix with Decoupler

In this step, our goal is to perform a "bioinformatic cell sorting" based on the annotated clusters of the single-cell data.

To start a pseudobulk analysis, ensure that the `AnnData` object contains all the necessary metadata for ***pseudobulking***. This includes key annotations such as `annotated` or `cell_type`, `condition`, `disease`, and `batch`. These labels may vary depending on how the dataset was originally annotated.

Most importantly, the `AnnData` object must include a layer containing the raw gene expression counts. This layer is essential for accurate aggregation and downstream differential expression analysis. Raw counts are allows to generate accurate pseudobulk aggregates. Since single-cell data is typically normalized after annotation, it’s important to preserve the raw counts in the AnnData object before normalization steps if you would like to perform a pseudobulk analysis later on. These raw counts are directly used by tools like **Decoupler** to generate the pseudobulk count matrix. Note that normalized count matrices should not be used with **Decoupler**, even if the tool appears to process them successfully.

> <tip-title> Missing Raw Counts? </tip-title>
>
> If your AnnData object lacks raw counts, you can use the **[AnnData Operations](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ebi-gxa/anndata_ops/anndata_ops/1.9.3+galaxy0)** tool on the **[Single Cell Galaxy instance](https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu)**. This tool allows you to copy the `.X` matrix into a new layer that you may assign a new label, for e.g., `counts` or `raw_counts`, making it available as a parameter for Decoupler.
>
> Importantly, ensure that the copying of this matrix as a raw counts layer is done carefully and correctly. To verify that your AnnData object contains the necessary raw counts layer, you can use the **[Inspect AnnData Object](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/anndata_inspect/anndata_inspect/0.10.9+galaxy0)** tool. This tool helps confirm the presence of raw counts and other essential metadata in your AnnData object before proceeding with pseudobulk analysis.

# Differential Expression Analysis (DE) with edgeR

The tool **edgeR** is commonly used for differential expression (DE) analysis of pseudobulk aggregates in single-cell RNA-seq studies ({% cite Chen2024 %}). It calculates gene dispersions based on the total counts for each gene and adjusts these estimates using an approach called empirical Bayes. This method improves reliability by pooling information across all genes in the dataset to stabilize dispersion estimates, particularly for genes with low counts or limited data. By "borrowing strength" from the behavior of other genes, empirical Bayes reduces the risk of overestimating or underestimating variability, ensuring more robust and accurate results ({% cite Chen2024 %}). Differential expression is then evaluated using an exact test for the negative binomial distribution, which is similar to Fisher’s exact test but modified to handle the variability typically seen in RNA-seq data ({% cite Chen2024 %}).

In addition to exact tests, edgeR employs generalized linear models (GLMs), which allow for the analysis of more complex experimental designs. GLMs model gene counts as a function of experimental conditions (e.g., treatment groups or time points) and estimate how these conditions influence gene expression. Likelihood-based methods, such as quasi-likelihood (QL) approaches, are central to this framework. Standard likelihood methods evaluate the fit of the model to the data, while quasi-likelihood methods add an extra layer by explicitly accounting for biological and technical variability, improving the reliability of DE results. These models allow edgeR to identify subtle expression differences while controlling for overdispersion in the data ({% cite Chen2016 %}).

Several plots can be generated to assist in understanding the data and the results of the analysis, including Multidimensional scaling (MDS), Biological Coefficient of Variation plot (BCV), Quasi-Likelihood (QL), and Mean-Difference plot o MA (MD) plots. These visualizations provide insights into sample relationships, variability, and differential expression, and will be explained further in the tutorial. With these concepts in mind, let's now perform our DE analysis using our edgeR tool in Galaxy!

## Sanitation Steps - Part 2

After performing the differential expression analysis with edgeR, we will clean the data to prepare it for visualization. This involves extracting dataset from a collection, removing unnecessary columns, standardizing text, and splitting the file if needed. We will use the {% tool [Extract dataset](__EXTRACT_DATASET__) %}, {% tool [Remove columns](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/column_remove_by_header/column_remove_by_header/1.0) %}.

# Volcano Plot

In this step, we will use the sanitized output from the previous steps to generate a Volcano Plot, which visualizes the relationship between statistical significance (P-value) and fold change (LogFC) for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The input file for the Volcano Plot must include four essential columns: _FDR (adjusted P-value), P-value (raw), Log Fold Change, and Gene Symbols (Labels)._ As long as these columns are present, the Volcano Plot can be generated successfully.

## What are the results of the Volcano Plot?

Let's take a moment to interpret the Volcano Plot:

# Subsetting Samples from the Original AnnData Object

In our initial analysis, we observed transcriptional differences between bone marrow and peripheral blood samples. However, since the dataset includes more than one immune cell type (pDCs and NCMs), it's not immediately clear which population is primarily driving these differences.

To gain further insight, it's helpful to perform pseudobulk analysis on each cell type separately. By subsetting the data by cluster and repeating the differential analysis (as we did with the full dataset at the start of this tutorial), we can better assess the individual contribution of each cell type.

In the following step, we’ll demonstrate how to subset the AnnData object by cell type before reapplying the pseudobulk workflow. In the hands-on example, we will filter for pDCs. To extract NCMs instead, you can follow the exact same steps, but set the *"Value"* parameter to `Non_Classical_Monocyte`, which corresponds to the annotation of that cell type.

If you would like to extract all annotated clusters at once, for example to analyse each of them independently, refer to the tip box below titled **“Split AnnData object by cluster or other observation key into a collection”**.

After using the {% tool [Scanpy filter](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/scanpy_filter/scanpy_filter/1.10.2+galaxy3) %} to extract the cell type of interest, return to the **Pseudobulk with Decoupler** step at the beginning of this tutorial. You can now repeat the same steps using this smaller AnnData object, which contains only the selected cell type (e.g., pDCs). The resulting analysis will reveal differential gene expression between conditions (e.g., COVID-19 vs. healthy) for that specific cell type only.

> 3. After performing pseudobulk analysis on pDCs and NCMs independently, how do the volcano plots compare? Do they reveal differentially expressed genes between tissues? If so, which cell type appears to drive the tissue-specific differences?

Based on the results, NCMs show stronger transcriptional differences and appear to be the main contributors to the tissue-specific expression patterns observed in the full dataset.

## Recommendations
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Ensure raw counts are preserved in your AnnData object before pseudobulk analysis.
   - Verify the presence of important metadata fields to ensure meaningful grouping and contrasts.
2. **Focus on Subsets:**
   - Analyse subsets of cell types or clusters for more granular insights. For example, pseudobulk analysis focused on specific immune cell populations can reveal subtle but important expression changes.
3. **Quality Control:**
   - Always inspect the outputs of Decoupler (e.g., pseudobulk plots and filtering summaries) to confirm data integrity and address outliers.
   - Use edgeR’s diagnostic plots (e.g., MDS, BCV) to check for batch effects or unexpected variability.
4. **Follow-Up Analysis:**
   - Consider functional analysis (e.g., GO enrichment, pathway analysis) for the differentially expressed genes to link expression changes to biological processes.
   - Use visualization tools, such as heatmaps or boxplots, to further explore expression trends in key genes.
5. **Future Applications:**
   - Pseudobulk analysis can be extended to multi-condition experiments, time-course data, or other cell-type-specific investigations.
