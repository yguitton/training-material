# Introduction

Image annotations and model training are essential in bioimage analysis tasks.  In biology and related fields, researchers often deal with large volumes of microscopy images that require accurate annotation to train machine learning models.  Automate this process can save time and improve reproducibility, but high-quality training data remains critical. Human-in-the-loop workflows have emerged as a solution to bridge the gap between manual annotation and automated model training, enabling iterative improvements through user interaction.

This tutorial introduces a reusable human-in-the-loop image segmentation and training workflow implemented in Galaxy, designed to streamline the creation of custom segmentation models using YOLO (You Only Look Once). The workflow integrates both interactive and headless tools. We demonstrate the workflow here with tail analysis images from growing embryo samples. The workflow can also be adapted to other datasets with minimal adjustments.

# Preprocessing the images 

The example dataset used in this tutorial consists of images in TIFF format. However, the YOLO training tool in Galaxy currently supports only JPEG (JPG) images. Therefore, as a necessary preprocessing step, the input images must be converted to the appropriate format. In this workflow, we first apply histogram equalization to the images and then convert them from TIFF to JPG.

It's important to note that these preprocessing steps are tailored to the example data. When applying this workflow to other images, the specific preprocessing steps may vary. Format conversion is mandatory if the images are not already in JPG, but contrast enhancement or other adjustments may or may not be needed depending on images. Users should adapt this part of the workflow to best suit their own data.

## Perform histogram equalization

>    - *"Histogram equalization algorithm"*: `CLAHE`
> 2. Rename {% icon galaxy-pencil %} the output collection to `input-normalized`.

# Annotating the images
Once the input images are preprocessed and converted to JPG format, we will need to manually annotate the images using AnyLabeling. AnyLabeling is an interactive labeling tool integrated into Galaxy that allows users to draw bounding boxes or other shapes around objects of interest. 

In this tutorial, we annotate all 22 example images using the tool's `Auto labeling` function, which helps accelerate the annotation process. The labels will later be used to train the YOLO model. The annotation process is entirely human-in-the-loop, so the quality and relevance of the labels directly influence the performance of the resulting model. 

> <hands-on-title> Interactive Annotation </hands-on-title>

> 1. Start {% tool [AnyLabeling Interactive](interactive_tool_anylabeling) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input images"*: `input-converted` (Input dataset collection, output of **Convert image format** {% icon tool %})
>    - *"Pre-existing annotations"*: `Empty`
>    - *"Classes file"*: `Empty`
>    - *"A tarball containing custom model files and yaml files"*: `Empty`
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/interactive_tools_open.md  %}

> 2. Once AnyLabeling is open.
>    - Navigate to `File` -> `Change Output Dir` and set the output directory to `working/home/output`.
> ![al change output dir](../../images/yolo-train/al_chng_dir.png){: width="75%"}

>    - To open your input images, go to `File` -> `Open Dir`, and choose `working/home/input_images` directory.
>
> ![al open dir](../../images/yolo-train/al_open_dir.png){: width="75%"}
>
>    - Click the `Auto Labeling` button, choose `Segment Anything 2 (Hiera-Tiny)` from the model dropdown, select `+Point`,then begin annotation by clicking on the object in the image. Wait for the inference to complete before continuing.
>
> ![al open dir](../../images/yolo-train/al_label.png){: width="75%"}
>
>    - If the inferred polygon is not accurate, click `-Point`, then click on a background (non-object) area to refine the results. The model will re-run the inference.

> ![al open dir](../../images/yolo-train/al_label_1.png){: width="75%"}
>    - After the inference is complete, click `Finish Object`. In the `Enter object label` box, type `tail` then click `OK` to save the annotation.
>
> ![al open dir](../../images/yolo-train/al_finish.png){: width="75%"}
>
>    - **Important:** The object label must match the content of `class_names.txt`.
>    - Repeat these steps for each image in the dataset to complete the interactive annotation process.

# Prepare training data
In this step, we will convert the annotation file generated by AnyLabeling (in JSON format) into YOLO compatible TXT files. This conversion is necessary because the YOLO training tool expects annotations in its specific text format, where each object is described by a class ID and corresponding bounding box coordinates.

# Extract complete training workflow from history
As an optional step, you can extract a complete workflow from your Galaxy history. This allows you to save and reuse the entire training process as a reproducible and shareable workflow.

# Using the trained model to label new images
Once training is complete, the resulting model can be used to label new images. The process of applying the trained model for inference is covered in a separate tutorial. Please refer to that tutorial for detailed instructions on how to use the model for prediction.


# Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to train a custom YOLO model for object detection and segmentation in bioimages using Galaxy. By combining image preprocessing, human-in-the-loop annotation, format conversion, and model training, we have built a complete workflow. We can apply the trained model to new image data and further refine our workflow as needed.
